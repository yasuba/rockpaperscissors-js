#Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
## The Javascript version

The purpose of this project was to practice using Javascript, by taking a ruby rock, paper, scissors game and turning it into JS.

I used javascript and jQuery, Jasmine SpecRunner for testing, Sinatra for the server and HTML and CSS to make it look pretty.
